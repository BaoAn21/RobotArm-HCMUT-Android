# Android RobotArm Controller (HCMUT-Arctos)

This Android application serves as the "brain" and vision system for the **HCMUT-Arctos Robot Arm**. It utilizes the phone's camera to detect objects or faces and sends coordinate corrections to the robot via USB tethering.

This project is the companion software for the hardware repo: [HCMUT-Arctos GitHub](https://github.com/altairkaitou/robot_arctos_HCMUT).

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Face Tracking
* **Detection:** Detects human faces in real-time.
* **Movement:** Controls **2 Axes (X and Y)**.
* **Behavior:** The robot rotates the base (Motor 0) and moves the elbow (Motor 2) to keep the detected face centered in the frame.

### 2. Color Tracking (Yellow Object)
* **Detection:** Tracks yellow objects based on HSV color thresholding.
* **Movement:** Controls **3 Axes (X, Y, and Z/Depth)**.
* **Behavior:**
    * **X/Y:** Keeps the object centered.
    * **Z (Depth):** Automatically moves the robot **Forward (Motor 1)** or **Backward** based on the object's size (Area Percentage).
    * **Target Range:** Maintains the object size between **6.0%** and **10%** of the screen area.

## 🛠️ Setup & Connection

### Prerequisites
1.  **Android Device** with this app installed.
2.  **USB Cable** connecting the phone to the Raspberry Pi (or PC) controlling the robot.
3.  **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** installed on the Pi/PC.

### 🔌 Critical Step: Port Forwarding
Because the robot and the phone are connected via USB (not WiFi), they need a way to talk to each other. The Android app acts as a **TCP Server** on port 6000. The Python script on the robot acts as a **Client**.

To create a "virtual bridge" so the robot can see the phone's server, you must run this command in your terminal:

```bash
adb forward tcp:6000 tcp:6000
```
Here is the rest of the README.md content you need, starting from the "Why is this needed?" section.

**Why is this needed?**
* This command tells the computer: *"Take any data sent to my local port 6000 and forward it instantly through the USB cable to the phone's port 6000."*
* Without this, the Python script will try to connect to `127.0.0.1:6000` and fail because it cannot "see" the phone inside the USB connection.
